# HERA Metrics

Repository for filtering, flagging, and quality metrics for 21cm cosmology using discrete
prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS).

## Flagging Radio Frequency Interference

Here we include methods for flagging radio frequency interference by fitting DPSS vectors using robust regression techniques.
