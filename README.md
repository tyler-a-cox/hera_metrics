# HERA Metrics

Repository for filtering, flagging, and quality metrics for 21cm cosmology using discrete
prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS).

## Flagging Radio Frequency Interference

A major problem in the field of 21cm cosmology is radio frequency interference (RFI).

Here we include methods for flagging radio frequency interference
